# Multi-armed Bandit Experimental Design: Online Decision-making and Adaptive Inference 

David Simchi-Levi, Chonghuan Wang<br>Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, MIT


#### Abstract

Multi-armed bandit has been well-known for its efficiency in online decision-making in terms of minimizing the loss of the participants' welfare during experiments (i.e., the regret). In clinical trials and many other scenarios, the statistical power of inferring the treatment effects (i.e., the gaps between the mean outcomes of different arms) is also crucial. Nevertheless, minimizing the regret entails harming the statistical power of estimating the treatment effect, since the observations from some arms can be limited. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between efficiency and statistical power by casting the multiarmed bandit experimental design into a minimax multi-objective optimization problem. We introduce the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the situation in which neither the statistical power nor the efficiency can be improved without degrading the other. We derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions. Additionally, we design an effective Pareto optimal multiarmed bandit experiment that can be tailored to different levels of the trade-off between the two objectives.


## 1 Introduction
The minimax optimal regret of stochastic MAB has been well understood to be $\widetilde{\Theta}(\log n)$, which can be achieved by the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithms (see, Lai et al. 1985) and Thompson sampling (TS) based algorithms (see, Thompson 1933).



Crucial challenges arise. 
- MAB algorithms collect data adaptively and consequently, it is not appropriate to consider the collected data as i.i.d. MAB algorithms are effective in learning the optimal online decision-making policy, but lack statistical power. 

- In contrast, some existing well-established ATE estimation methods are recognized for their strong statistical power, but will incur significant regrets. 
    - Specifically, since a predetermined percentage of the population will be assigned to the suboptimal arm, the regret of a traditional RCT will increase linearly with the number of samples. 

- Moreover, the relationship between the two tasks, adaptive inference and online decision-making, may change throughout the experiment. 

    - In order to describe such a trade-off, we introduce the term "Pareto optimality" to characterize the circumstance where neither regret nor estimating error of ATE can be made better off without making the other worse off. 

### 1.1 Preliminaries
- $\mathcal{A}$ of arms, $a \in \mathcal{A}$ with $|\mathcal{A}|=K$. 
- $n$ is the total number of experimental units (or the time horizon). 
- At each time $t$, the environment generates a reward $r_{t}(a)$. 
- After choosing arm $a_{t}$, only the reward of the chosen arm $r_{t}:=r_{t}\left(a_{t}\right)$ can be observed. 
- The expectation $\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t}(a)\right]=$ $\mu_{a} \in[-1,1]$
    - $\mu_{a}$ is the unknown true reward of arm $a$ which is disturbed by an i.i.d. noise to generate $r_{t}(a) \in$ $[-1,1]$
- A stochastic MAB instance can be denoted by $\nu=\left(P_{1}, \cdots, P_{K}\right)$, where $P_{i}$ is the distribution of the rewards of $\operatorname{arm} i$. 
- The optimal arm is the arm with the maximum mean reward denoted by $a^{*}:=\arg \max _{a \in \mathcal{A}} \mu_{a}$
    - The gap between arm $i$ and $\operatorname{arm} j$ as $\Delta^{(i, j)}:=\mu_{i}-\mu_{j}$. 
    - Difference between $\mu_{a^{*}}$ and $\mu_{a}$ as the suboptimality gap, i.e., $\Delta(a):=\mu_{a^{*}}-\mu_{a}$ for $a \in \mathcal{A} \backslash\left\{a^{*}\right\}$. 
- Specifically, when $K=2$, we can define arm 1 to be the treatment of interest and arm 2 to be a control, and thus $\Delta^{(1,2)}$ is the ATE. 
- In this paper, we will elaborate on $\left|\Delta^{(i, j)}\right|=\Theta(1)$ for all $i \neq j \in[K]$, which is arguably the most fundamental case. 
- Denote all stochastic MAB instances satisfying the mentioned assumptions to constitute a feasible set $\mathcal{E}_{0}$. 


- At every time $t$, the decision maker observes the history $\mathcal{H}_{t}=\left(a_{1}, r_{1}, \cdots, a_{t}, r_{t}\right)$. 
- An admissible policy $\pi=$ $\left\{\pi_{t}\right\}_{t \geq 1}$ maps the history $\mathcal{H}_{t-1}$ to an action $a_{t}$. 
    - $\pi_{t}(a)=\mathbb{P}\left(a_{t}=a \mid \mathcal{H}_{t-1}\right)$ under policy $\pi$
- accumulative regret
    - $\mathcal{R}(n, \pi)=\mathbb{E}^{\pi}\left[n \mu_{a^{*}}-\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}\left(a_{i}\right)\right]$
- An admissible adaptive estimator $\hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}=\left\{\hat{\Delta}_{t}^{(i, j)}\right\}_{t \geq 1}$ maps the history $\mathcal{H}_{t}$ to an estimation of $\Delta^{(i, j)}$ at each time $t$. 
- $\left.e\left(t, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)=\mathbb{E}\left[\left|\Delta^{(i, j)}-\hat{\Delta}_{t}^{(i, j)}\right|\right]\right)$ 
    - measure the quality of the estimation
- $\hat{\Delta}:=\{\hat{\Delta}(i, j)\}_{i<j \leq K}$: all the estimators on the gap between any two arms
- A design of an MAB experiment can then be represented by an admissible pair $(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$. 
- The optimal design of MAB experiments in this paper is solving the following minimax multi-objective optimization problem:

$$
\min _{(\pi, \hat{\Delta})} \max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left(\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi), \max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)\right)
$$
- 
    - minimizing the regret and the inference error under the worst case. 
    - For traditional MAB problems, $\min _{\pi} \max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}} \mathcal{R}(n, \pi)$ is usually the only objective. 
    - The asymptotic behavior of $\hat{\Delta}$ is one of the central focuses of ATE literature. 
    - Note that $\pi$ and $\hat{\Delta}$ are complicatedly correlated through the history $\mathcal{H}$.

- start from the inner maximization over all $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$ 
    - Intuitively, under a given $(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$, the pairs $\left(\mathcal{R}_{\nu}, \max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\right)$ for all $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$ can constitute an accessible region, and the front of the accessible region can be defined to be the optimal values of the inner maximum problem (see, Figure 1).  

> Definition 1 (Front). The front for $(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$, denoted by $\mathcal{F}(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$, consists of all pairs of $(R, e)$ satisfying: 
> - $(i) \exists \nu \in$ $\mathcal{E}_{0},\left(\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi), \max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)\right)=(R, e)$; 
> - (ii) $\nexists \nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}, \max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)>e$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi) \geq$ $R$; 
> - (iii) $\exists \nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}, \max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right) \geq e$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)>R$.

- The first condition ensures the achievability of the front. 
- The second and the third conditions
    - there does not exist any instance that will incur no fewer (more) values on both objectives and a strictly larger value on at least one. 
- In Figure 1 , the yellow region and its boundary are an example of the accessible region and front, respectively. 
- RCTs. 
    - Since $\left|\Delta^{(i, j)}\right|=\Theta(1)$ for the instance class $\mathcal{E}_{0}$, the RCTs will usually incur linear regrets.
    - By the theoretical results for RCTs, the best achievable accuracy is $\Theta\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$
    - Thus the front for RCTs is at the point $\left(n, n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ 
    - The worst-case regret of any policy is no smaller than $\log (n)$, and thus any accessible region will inevitably have some parts on or above the $\log (n)$ line.



> Definition 2 (Pareto dominance). A feasible solution $\left(\pi_{1}, \hat{\Delta}_{1}\right)$ Pareto dominates another solution $\left(\pi_{2}, \hat{\Delta}_{2}\right)$ 
> - if $\forall\left(R_{1}, e_{1}\right) \in \mathcal{F}\left(\pi_{1}, \hat{\Delta}_{1}\right), \exists\left(R_{2}, e_{2}\right) \in \mathcal{F}\left(\pi_{2}, \hat{\Delta}_{2}\right)$, such that at least one of the following two conditions holds: 
> - (i) $R_{1} \leq R_{2}$ and $e_{1}<e_{2}$ 
> - or (ii) $R_{1}<R_{2}$ and $e_{1} \leq e_{2}$.

The definition formally describes that $\left(\pi_{1}, \hat{\Delta}_{1}\right)$ is Pareto better than $\left(\pi_{2}, \hat{\Delta}_{2}\right)$ if for any point $\left(R_{1}, e_{1}\right)$ on the front of $\left(\pi_{1}, \hat{\Delta}_{1}\right)$, there exists some point $\left(R_{2}, e_{2}\right)$ on the front of $\left(\pi_{2}, \hat{\Delta}_{2}\right)$ such that $\left(R_{1}, e_{1}\right)$ is no larger than $\left(R_{2}, e_{2}\right)$ on both coordinates and is strictly better on at least one coordinate.

- $\left(\pi_{b}, \hat{\Delta}_{b}\right)$ Pareto dominates $\left(\pi_{a}, \hat{\Delta}_{a}\right)$, and $\left(\pi_{c}, \hat{\Delta}_{c}\right)$ can neither Pareto dominate nor be Pareto dominated by $\left(\pi_{a}, \hat{\Delta}_{a}\right)$ or $\left(\pi_{b}, \hat{\Delta}_{b}\right)$. 

> Definition 3 (Pareto Optimality). An admissible pair of $\left(\pi^{*}, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right)$ is Pareto optimal in terms of the dependence on $n$, if it is not Pareto dominated by any other solution. Pareto frontier denoted as $\mathcal{P}$ is the envelop of the fronts of all the Pareto optimal solutions.

- How to solve the minimax multi-objective optimization problem to get the Pareto optimal solutions. 
- Moreover, $\pi$ and $\hat{\Delta}$ have the measurability constraints and are highly correlated through the history $\mathcal{H}_{t}$, which are hard to explicitly integrate into the optimization problem and endow the feasible region with complicated structures. 
- How to obtain the optimal Pareto optimal solutions given different levels of trade-off in these two objectives.

### 1.2 Contributions and Main Results

- First, we find a sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions of the minimax multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, an admissible pair $\left(\pi^{*}, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right)$ is Pareto optimal if and only if

$$
\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{*(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi^{*}\right)}\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)
$$

- - An information theoretical minimax lower bound to portray the trade-off between these two objectives. Specifically,

$$
\inf _{(\pi, \hat{\Delta})} \max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}\right]=\Omega(1)
$$

- - This lower bound tells that no solution can do better on $\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}$ than a constant order in the worst case. 
    - Particularly, since UCB/TS algorithms have the regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$, then any ATE estimator based on the UCB/TS algorithm cannot avoid an error of $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}}\right)$ in the worst case. 
    - This explicitly shows the lack of statistical power of UCB/TS algorithms on ATE inference. 
- - On the other hand, we also show that the Pareto frontier is the curve that satisfies $\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}=\widetilde{\Theta}(1)$.

- Second, we propose an efficient Pareto optimal algorithm for stochastic MAB experiments which can adapt to different levels of trade-off between the two objectives. 
    - Specifically, we combine the well-known EXP3 algorithm (see, e.g., Auer et al. 2002a, Seldin et al. 2013) 
    - and the idea of extra forced exploration which means that the algorithm purposely plays the other arms after it identifies the best one. 
    - For any given $\alpha \in[0,1]$ as input, we prove that the regret of our algorithm is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n^{1-\alpha}\right)$ and the estimation error of ATE is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t^{1-\alpha}}}\right)$ for all $t \leq n$, showing its Pareto optimality. 
    - Note that $\alpha$ balances the two objectives. If $\alpha$ is large, the practitioners emphasize the control of regret. Small $\alpha$ will lead to a more accurate ATE estimation. 
    - Technically, a common practice when using the EXP3 algorithm is to estimate the expected rewards of each arm with inverse propensity weighted (IPW) estimators, which imposes the challenge on careful variance control.

## 2 MAB Experimental Design for $K=2$

We focus on $K=2$ to illustrate our ideas. 
- We first establish the crucial lower bound and the sufficient condition for the Pareto optimality. 
- Then, we propose a series of Pareto optimal designs and show the necessity of the condition based on the constructed Pareto optimal solutions. - For brevity, we adopt the $\Delta$ instead of $\Delta^{(1,2)}$, since there is no ambiguity when $K=2$.

### 2.1 A Lower Bound and A Sufficient Condition

In this subsection, we start with establishing an lower bound for $\left(e_{\nu}(n, \hat{\Delta})\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}$. In the following theorem, we establish an important minimax lower bound.

Theorem 1. For any admissible pair $\left(\pi, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right)$, there always exists a hard instance $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$ that $e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}$ is no less than a constant order, i.e.,

$$
\inf _{\left(\pi, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right)} \max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}\right]=\Omega(1)
$$

Theorem 1 states that for any admissible pair $\left(\pi, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right)$, there usually exists a challenging instance $\nu \in \mathcal{E}$ such that the product of estimation error and regret is lower-bounded by $n^{p}$ for some positive value of $p$. This mathematically highlights the trade-off between the two objectives. A small regret will inevitably have a large error on the ATE estimation. Roughly speaking, the expected error is almost lower bounded by the inverse of the square root of the regret in the worst case, i.e., $e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right)=\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}}\right)$. In particular, since $\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)=\mathcal{O}(\log (n))$ for UCB and TS algorithms, no estimators can not achieve smaller error than the order $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log (n)}}\right)$ consistently over all the possible instances. Although $\log (n)$ increases with $n$, the speed is rather slow which explicitly shows the limitation of regretoptimal policies in terms of statistical power for estimating the ATE.

In Theorem 1, we have shown that no solution can perform better than a constant order in terms of $e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}$ in the worst case. The following theorem states one policy is Pareto optimal if it can achieve the constant order on $e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}$ in terms of the dependence on $n$.

Theorem 2. An admissible pair $(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$ is Pareto optimal if

$$
\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[e_{\nu}(n, \hat{\Delta}) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)
$$

Together with Theorem 1, if Eq. (3) is satisfied, we can directly draw the conclusion that $(\pi, \hat{\Delta})$ is optimal in terms of the metric $\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[e_{\nu}(n, \hat{\Delta}) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}\right]$. However, whether the optimality on such a metric can guarantee the Pareto optimality is what we want to answer in Theorem 2. Comparing with the definition of Pareto optimality, Eq.

(3) seems relatively more straightforwards and practical to verify. For example, consider the traditional RCTs where a half of experimental units are treated and controlled, respectively. For any $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}, e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{\mathrm{RCT}}\right)=\widetilde{O}(1 / \sqrt{n})$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi_{\mathrm{RCT}}\right)=\Theta(n)$, and thus they are Pareto optimal.

### 2.2 An Algorithm and A Necessary Condition

Although the RCTs are Pareto optimal, they can not be easily adapted to different levels of trade-off between the two objectives. In this subsection, we propose a flexible algorithm satisfying Eq. (3) for $K=2$ with the analysis of the regret upper bound and the error bound for inference. Then, we will prove that the condition (3) is necessary.

### 2.2.1 Algorithm and regret upper bound

We adopt the idea of the famous EXP3 algorithm for adversarial MAB (see, e.g., Seldin et al. 2013, Auer et al. 2002a), together with the idea to force the algorithm to actively explore the suboptimal arm, to design our EXP3 with exploration (EXP3E) algorithm shown in Algorithm 1.

We first define a set of random variables $\hat{R}_{t}(a)$ for $a \in$ $\{1,2\}$ based on inverse propensity score weight (IPW) as: $\hat{R}_{t}(a)=\hat{R}_{t-1}(a)+\frac{R_{t}}{\pi_{t}(a)} \mathbb{I}_{a=A_{t}}$, which can provide an unbiased estimation of $\mu_{a}$ after being divided by $t$, i.e., $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{R}_{t}(a)\right]=\mu_{a} t$. We also define $\hat{R}_{t}^{\max }$ as $\max _{a \in\{1,2\}} \hat{R}_{t}(a)$. One may think a more straightforward way to estimate $\mu_{a}$ is the simple sample average $\frac{\sum_{s=1}^{t} \mathbb{I}_{a=A_{t}} R_{t}}{\sum_{s=1}^{t} \mathbb{I}_{a=A_{t}}}$. However, such an estimator is neither unbiased nor asymptotically normal because whether we take action $a$ at time $t$ is highly correlated with the past history as is pointed by the recent works (see, e.g., Xu et al. 2013, Luedtke and Van Der Laan 2016, Hadad et al. 2021, Nie et al. 2018, Zhang et al. 2020). Thus, the ATE based on the simple sample average will inevitably be biased. The first phase of our algorithm is aiming at identifying the best arm with well-controlled regret. In this phase, the algorithm is adaptively polishing its decision policy to gain confidence about which arm is the optimal one, according to the estimated reward $\hat{R}_{t}(a)$. There are many ways to map $\hat{R}_{t}(a)$ into probabilities, among which a popular choice is exponential weighting as $\pi_{t}(a)=\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{t-1} \hat{R}_{t-1}(a)}}{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} e^{\varepsilon_{t-1} \hat{R}_{t-1}(a)}}$. Note that the decision maker knows the exactly $\pi_{t}(a)$, different from the classical offline ATE inference. If at time $t$ there exists an arm $a$ such that $\hat{R}_{t}(a)$ is larger than the other by at least $\Omega(\sqrt{t})$, the algorithm believes $a$ is the optimal arm and eliminates the other arm. Formally, our elimination rule is $\mathcal{A}_{t+1}=\mathcal{A}_{t} \backslash\left\{a \in \mathcal{A}_{t}: \hat{R}_{t}^{\max }-\hat{R}_{t}(a)>2 \sqrt{C t}\right\}$, where $C$ is a constant defined in Algorithm 1. Note that when the first phase ends is a stopping time with respect to the history $\mathcal{H}_{t}$. We define two stopping times as $\tau(a)=$ $\max \left\{t: a \in \mathcal{A}_{t}\right\}$ for $a \in\{1,2\}$, and then the first phase ends after $\min _{a \in\{1,2\}} \tau(a)$ periods. By a careful analysis, the length of the first phase can be shown in the order $1 / \Delta^{2}$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_11_09_dcce4180771ed0085af4g-06.jpg?height=726&width=805&top_left_y=346&top_left_x=1067)

After eliminating the suboptimal arm, EXP 3E operates into the second phase. The algorithm is forced to play the arm which was identified as the suboptimal one in the first phase with a carefully controlled probability $\alpha_{t}=\frac{1}{2 t^{\alpha}} . \alpha$ is an important input parameter that balances our two tasks. In the following, we will see soon that a small $\alpha$ can help the algorithm to have a more accurate estimator of $\Delta$, while sacrificing the regret.

Theorem 3. Let Algorithm 1 runs with any given $\alpha \in[0,1]$ and $\delta=\frac{1}{2 n^{2}}$. The regret is

$$
\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log (n)}{\Delta}+n^{1-\alpha} \Delta \log (n)\right)
$$

The regret bound in Theorem 3 decreases with $\alpha$, which is consistent with our intuition that a large $\alpha$ restricts the probability to play the suboptimal arm in the second phase. When $\alpha=1$, the regret bound in Theorem 3 becomes $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log (n)}{\Delta}+\Delta \log (n)\right)$, which matches with the optimal regret bound of MAB in current literature (see, e.g., Lattimore and Szepesvári 2020) up to logarithmic factors. This means that if minimizing the accumulative regret is the only objective (i.e., ignoring the inference task), by setting $\alpha=1$, the performance of our EXP 3E is unimprovable in terms of the dependency on the learning horizon $n$. Another extreme case is when $\alpha=0$, the regret upper bound grows linearly with the learning horizon $T$. When $\alpha$ is set to be 0 , in the second phase, the exploration probability remains to be $\frac{1}{2}$. This indicates that in the second phase EXP 3E is doing random control trials. Moreover, if $|\Delta|=\Theta(1)$, Theorem 3 has an immediate corollary.

Corollary 1. With any given $\alpha \in[0,1], \delta=\frac{1}{2 n^{2}}$ and $|\Delta|=$ $\Theta(1)$, the regret of Algorithm 1 is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n^{1-\alpha}\right)$.

### 2.2.2 Inference for ATE

Now, we are going to focus on the problem of inference of $\Delta$. Since we have shown $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{R}_{t}(a)\right]=\mu_{a} t$, we can define a set of martingales as $M_{t}^{a}=\hat{R}_{t}(a)-\mu_{a} t$ for $a \in \mathcal{A}$, and $M_{t}^{(1,2)}:=M_{t}^{1}-M_{t}^{2}=t \hat{\Delta}_{t}-t \Delta$. We can directly have,

Theorem 4. For $t \in[n], \hat{\Delta}_{t}$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{\Delta}_{t}\right]=\Delta$.

Then, how well our $\hat{\Delta}_{t}$ can estimate $\Delta$ becomes the central problem that we need to solve. For any $t \in[n]$, the martingale difference of $M_{t}^{(1,2)}$ can be bounded by $\left|M_{t}^{(1,2)}-M_{t-1}^{(1,2)}\right|=2+1 / \pi_{t}(1)+1 / \pi_{t}(2)$. Moreover, the variance of the martingale $M_{t}^{(1,2)}$ can be bounded as $\sum_{t=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\frac{R_{t}}{\pi_{t}(1)} \mathbb{I}_{A_{t}=1}-\frac{R_{t}}{\pi_{t}(2)} \mathbb{I}_{A_{t}=2}-\Delta\right)^{2} \mid \mathcal{H}_{t-1}\right] \leq$ $\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\pi_{t}(1)}+\frac{1}{\pi_{t}(2)}$. A common concern about IPW-based method is its large variance, especially when $\pi_{t}(a)$ is small (e.g., Dimakopoulou et al. 2021). The blessing of online learning is that we can control the propensity score. However, it also imposes an important challenge. Assigning a small probability to the suboptimal arm can bring us a small regret but a large variance of the estimators which may harm the inference. In the second phase of our EXP 3E, $\frac{1}{\pi_{t}(1)}+\frac{1}{\pi_{t}(2)} \leq 2 t^{\alpha}$ by the design of our algorithm. As for the first phase, from the proof of Theorem 3, our elimination rules contribute to securing $\frac{1}{\pi_{t}(a)} \leq 1+e^{2}$ for $a \in \mathcal{A}$. In this way, we control the variance of $M_{t}^{(1,2)}$. By Bernstein's inequality (Freedman 1975), we can have the following theorem.

Theorem 5. If Algorithm 1 runs with $\alpha \in[0,1]$ and $\delta<$ $2 / e$, with probability at least $1-\delta$, for all $t \in[n]$,

$$
\left|\hat{\Delta}_{t}-\Delta\right| \leq \frac{\left(8 e^{2}+16\right) \log \frac{2}{\delta}}{\sqrt{t^{1-\alpha}}}
$$

Furthermore, since we can take $\delta=\frac{1}{2 n^{2}}, e(n, \hat{\Delta})=$ $\mathbb{E}\left[\left|\hat{\Delta}_{n}-\Delta\right|\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^{1-\alpha}}}\right)$.

Different from most existing results on adaptive estimators in the inference literature that are asymptotic in nature, Theorem 5 is a finite sample properties which has its own advantages when the number or samples are relatively small. Another important difference with offline inference lies in that Theorem 5 is an any-time bound since it holds for all $t \in[n]$. In addition, the RHS of Eq. (5) increases with the value of $\alpha$. Intuitively, when $\alpha$ is small, $\operatorname{EXP} 3 \mathrm{E}$ is more likely to explore during the second phase of our algorithm, which will help to estimate of the reward of the suboptimal arm, and thus improve our inference. However, there is no free lunch. In contrast, the regret upper bound in Theorem 3 will be large. Such observations illustrate the role that $\alpha$ plays in balancing online learning and inference.

Together with Corollary 1 and Theorem 5, we can safely draw the following statement.
Corollary 2. For any instance $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$ and $\alpha \in[0,1]$, Algorithm 1 can guarantee $e_{\nu}(n, \hat{\Delta}) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$. Furthermore, by Theorem 1, Algorithm 1 achieves the Pareto optimality for any $\alpha \in[0,1]$.

For simplicity, we denote the online decision-making policy and ATE estimator with input parameter $\alpha$ in Algorithm 1 as $\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)$. By Theorem 1, the front of $\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)$ is $\mathcal{F}\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)=\left\{\left(n^{1-\alpha}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{n^{1-\alpha}}}\right)\right\}$. With different input of $\alpha \in[0,1]$, the front of our $\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)$ will cover the line $e(n, \hat{\Delta}) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}=1$, which is the Pareto frontier. The front for $\alpha=0$ coincides with that of RCTs.

### 2.2.3 The sufficient and necessary condition

Based on the series of $\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)$, the following theorem illustrates the necessity of the condition (3). The main idea is that any policy violating condition (3) will be Pareto dominated by $\left(\pi_{\alpha}, \hat{\Delta}_{\alpha}\right)$ for some $\alpha$, and thus can not be Pareto optimal.

Theorem 6. Any Pareto optimal $\left(\pi^{*}, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right)$ satisfies $\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi^{*}\right)}\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$.

Together with Theorems 2 and 6 , we formally confirm the condition (3) is sufficient and necessary for the Pareto optimal solutions for $K=2$.

Corollary 3. The admissible pair $\left(\pi^{*}, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right)$ is Pareto optimal to the minimax multi-objective optimization (1) if and only if $\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi^{*}\right)}\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$.

In Figure 3, we present several examples of the possible fronts of the admissible policies. First, the lower bound in Eq. (2) tells that the front of any admissible policy has intersection of the region $\mathcal{R}(n, \pi) \gtrsim 1 /(e(n, \widehat{\Delta}))^{2}$ (the blue region). The sufficient and necessary condition indicates that the Pareto optimal solutions will only intersect with the blue region on the boundary $\mathcal{R}(n, \pi) \simeq 1 /(e(n, \hat{\Delta}))^{2}$. In turn, any policy that intersects with the region on the boundary are Pareto optimal. The red curve is non Pareto optimal, since it partly falls into the interior of the region.

## 3 Extension to General $K$

In this section, we extend our model, algorithm and analysis to a general $K \geq 2$. The main ideas of EXP3EG in Algorithm 2 follow from those of EXP 3E. However, since the suboptimal arms are usually unlikely to be eliminated at the same time, EXP 3EG can not be divided into two phases explicitly anymore. Following the same notatition as before, we assign $a \notin \mathcal{A}_{t}$ a time-varying but fixed probability $\alpha_{t}=\frac{1}{K t^{\alpha}}$ to be played. For $a \in \mathcal{A}_{t}$, we assign the probability $\left(1-\left|\mathcal{A}_{t}^{c}\right| \alpha_{t}\right) \frac{e^{\varepsilon_{t-1} \hat{R}_{t-1}(a)}}{\sum_{a^{\prime} \in \mathcal{A}_{t}} e^{\varepsilon_{t-1} \hat{R}_{t-1}\left(a^{\prime}\right)}}$. The elimination rule is still $\mathcal{A}_{t+1}=\mathcal{A}_{t} \backslash\left\{a: \hat{R}_{t}^{\max }-\hat{R}_{t}(a)>2 \sqrt{C t}\right\}$. Moreover, notably, EXP 3EG is powerful enough to output $\hat{\Delta}_{i, j}$ for all $i \neq j \in[K]$ at the same time, which means EXP3EG does not need to know which $\Delta_{i, j}$ is of interest in advance. We can have the following theorem on regret.

Theorem 7. Let Algorithm 2 run with $\alpha \in[0,1]$ and $\delta=\frac{1}{2 n^{2}}$. The regret is $\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{a \in[K] /\left\{a^{*}\right\}} \frac{\log (n)}{\Delta(a)}+\right.$ $\left.\Delta(a) n^{1-\alpha} \log (n)\right)$.

When $\alpha=1$, the regret upper bound in Theorem 7 matches with the minimax lower bounds for MAB problems up to a logarithmic factor. Also, since we mainly care about $|\Delta(a)|=\Theta(1)$, the regret bounds becomes $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{1-\alpha}\right)$. In Theorem 7, the regret upper bound is only dependent on the gaps with the optimal arm $\Delta(a)$ instead of all $\left|\Delta^{(i, j)}\right|$. Intuitively, $\Delta(a)$ has a more important role than $\left|\Delta^{(i, j)}\right|$, since the regret is defined to compete with the optimal arm.

For inference, following the notation defined in Section 2.2, we introduce a series of martingales $M_{t}^{(i, j)}:=M_{t}^{i}-M_{t}^{j}$ for any $i \neq j \in[K]$, where recall that $M_{t}^{i}=\hat{R}_{t}(i)-$ $\mu_{i} t$. An immediate result is unbiasedness, i.e., $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{\Delta}_{t}^{(i, j)}\right]=$ $\Delta^{(i, j)}$ for $t \in[n]$. We extend the result in Theorem 5 as following to a fixed pair of $i, j$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_11_09_dcce4180771ed0085af4g-08.jpg?height=621&width=753&top_left_y=1809&top_left_x=205)

Theorem 8. If Algorithm 2 runs with $\alpha \in[0,1]$, for any fixed $i, j \in[k], i \neq j$, and $\delta<2 / e$, with probability at least $1-\delta$, for all $t \in[n]$,

$$
\left|\hat{\Delta}_{t}^{(i, j)}-\Delta^{(i, j)}\right| \leq \frac{4\left(2+2 K^{2}\left(1+e^{2}\right)\right) \log \frac{2}{\delta}}{\sqrt{t^{1-\alpha}}} .
$$

Particularly, after taking $\delta=\frac{1}{2 n^{2}}$, we can derive $\max _{i<j \leq K} e\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{(i, j)}\right)=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^{1-\alpha}}}\right)$.

Then, together with Theorem 7, $\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{(i, j)}\right)\right)$ $\sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}=\widetilde{O}(1)$ holds for any $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$. Taking $i^{*}$ and $j^{*}$ to be the best and the second best arm respectively, we always have $\max _{i<j \leq K} e\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{(i, j)}\right) \geq e\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{\left(i^{*}, j^{*}\right)}\right)$. By such a fact, we can reduce the problem with $K>2$ to $K=2$. Theorem 2 can be easily generalized, and thus the sufficient condition for Pareto optimality can be $\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)}=\widetilde{O}(1)$. Hence, Algorithm 2 is Pareto optimal for all $\alpha \in[0,1]$. Then the necessity of the condition follows similarly from Theorem 6 . We can naturally extend Corollary 3 as follows.

Theorem 9. The admissible pair $\left(\pi^{*}, \hat{\Delta}^{*}\right)$ is Pareto optimal to the optimization problem (1) if and only if $\max _{\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}}\left[\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}_{n}^{*(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi^{*}\right)}\right]=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$.

## 4 Discussion

In the previous sections, we restrict ourselves to the instance class $\mathcal{E}_{0}$, where $\Delta^{(i, j)}=\Theta(1)$ for all $i, j \in[K]$, which is usually referred to as the "well-separated" instance class (see, e.g., Kalvit and Zeevi 2021). Such an instance class allows us to see the magnitude of $\Delta^{(i, j)}$ as a universal constant independent of $n$ and ignore its influence when deriving the necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto optimality. In this section, we first discuss about the case where $\Delta^{(i, j)}$ is extremely small comparing with the time horizon $n$ or can even shrink with $n$ (i.e., $\Delta^{(i, j)}=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-p}\right)$ for some strictly positive $\left.p>0\right)$. For simplicity, we will focus on $K=2$ since $K>2$ naturally follows.

Case 1: $\Delta=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1 / 2}\right)$. As known in current literature (see, e.g., Lattimore and Szepesvári 2020 and Kalvit and Zeevi 2021), approximately $\frac{1}{\Delta^{2}}$ samples are unavoidable to distinguish between two distributions with means separated by $\Delta$. This indicates that if $\Delta=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1 / 2}\right)$, even the most efficient adaptive algorithm which only cares about the regret rate will spend $\Theta(n)$ samples on the suboptimal arm and thus the regret is doomed to be roughly $n \Delta$. No one can expect to increase the statistical power by sacrificing the online decision-making efficiency, which itself has no room to be sacrificed. Therefore, the main question becomes what level the estimation error can be controlled. By slight modifications of the proof of Theorem 5, we can show our estimator $\hat{\Delta}$ can achieve $e(n, \hat{\Delta})=\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1 / 2}\right)$ when $\Delta=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1 / 2}\right)$, which can not be further improved
either. In this case, we have the strongest statistical power and an unavoidably large regret.

Case 2: $\Delta=\Omega\left(n^{-1 / 2}\right)$ and $\Delta=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$. Recall that $\alpha$ is the input of EXP3E controlling the trade-off between the two objectives. In this case, the regret upper bound in Theorem 3 reduces to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\log (n)}{\Delta}\right)$, which is not influenced by $\alpha$ and matches with the regret lower bound in the worst case (see, e.g., Lattimore and Szepesvári 2020). This means that when $n^{-1 / 2} \lesssim \Delta \lesssim n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}$, our EXP3E always has the optimal efficiency in online decision-making. Note that Theorem 5 still holds here, i.e., $e(n, \hat{\Delta})=\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$. We want to point out that by a simple modification of Lemma ??, in this case one feasible lower error bound is $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\Delta}{\log (n)}}\right)$, which we do not match with. Such kind of mismatch may be caused by the large variance of IPW-based estimator, especially during the second phase of the algorithm. It is also possible that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\Delta}{\log (n)}}\right)$ underestimates the difficulty of the problem with $n^{-1 / 2} \lesssim \Delta \lesssim n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}$. We leave this issue to our future research.

Case 3: $\Delta=\Omega\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$ and $\Delta<\Theta(1)$. In this case, Theorem 3 offers a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n^{1-\alpha} \Delta\right)$, whose proof inplies that the algorithm plays the suboptimal arm exact $\Theta\left(n^{1-\alpha}\right)$ times. And thus, by an easy extension of Lemma ??, the $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$ error bound offered by Theorem 5 is rate optimal. The problem here is that since we do not know the order of the magnitude of $\Delta$ in advance, we can hardly control the regret to the level that we want in the order of $n$. That is the price for the strong statistical power when $\Delta=\Omega\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$.

Up till now, we have discussed that EXP3E is somewhat optimal in some other senses under different orders of the small $\Delta$. However, what is the sufficient and necessary condition for the desired Pareto optimal for extremely small $\Delta$ is still unknown and we leave it to our future work.

The second aspect to consider is the neglect of constants and logarithm terms in defining Pareto optimality. While this is a common practice in $\mathrm{MAB}$, ignoring these terms can be significant, especially in cases where sample collection is costly or the number of samples is limited. Admittedly, such a simplification is another limitation of our work. It is very challenging to get optimal rates on the dependence of both constant and $n$. Even for the traditional MAB problem without the added complexity of inference, there is a lack of research addressing the best achievable dependence on constants. Another important consideration is the choice of the parameter $\alpha$, which plays a crucial role in our design. Choosing the appropriate $\alpha$ can be challenging in some cases, and there may be scenarios where a dynamic $\alpha$ would be more appropriate, especially in experiments that have a long duration. Understanding how people make decisions about choosing $\alpha$ is also important, but it is outside the scope of this work. Finally, a crucial next step is extending our work to continuous arm bandit problems, as our design and analysis are currently limited to discrete arms.

## 5 Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we statistically investigate the trade-off between efficiency in decision-making and statistical power of ATE in MAB experiments. We novelly introduce the general minimax multi-objective optimization framework and Pareto optimality to formally describe and theoretically analyze such a trade-off. Moreover, we derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for Pareto optimal designs, i.e., $\left(\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{*(i, j)}\right)\right) \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_{\nu}\left(n, \pi^{*}\right)}=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ for any instance $\nu \in \mathcal{E}_{0}$. Additionally, we propose an efficient Pareto optimal design with $\max _{i<j \leq K} e_{\nu}\left(n, \hat{\Delta}^{(i, j)}\right)=$ $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-(1-\alpha) / 2}\right)$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\nu}(n, \pi)=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{1-\alpha}\right)$ for any give $\alpha \in[0,1]$ controlling the desired level of trade-off.
